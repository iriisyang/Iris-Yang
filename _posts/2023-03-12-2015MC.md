# Corrections: 

## Question 4

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/2015q4.png?raw=true)

Topic 6.4: Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

The correct answer is C: The largest value in arr is negative. maxVal is initialized to be greater than all other values in the array. Negative will not allow this

## Question 9

Topic 2.9: Using the Math Class

The correct answer is E: 2 + (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6). Math.random() produces a decimal between 0 and 1, including 0. Therefore multiplying it by 6 will produce a value 0-5. The dice are 1-6 so you need to add 2.

## Question 13

Topic 6.4: Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

The correct answer is A: {17, 20, 21, 42, 45, 69, 48, 51, 39}. Only the first 3 values are changed. Updates the numbers at indexes 1, 4, and 7.

## Question 10

Topic 2.6: String Objects - Concatenation, Literals, and More

The correct answer is D: 0008. The first line initialized str as 0. Then the second adds 008 to what the string already had to result in 0008.

## Question 16

Topic 8.2: Traversing 2D Arrays

The correct answer is E: The column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array. Iterates through all rows and columns and finds the largest value.

## Question 18

Topic 1.3: Expressions and Assignment Statements

The correct answer is D: 401. Problem uses integer rounding so 404/10=40.

## Question 25

Topic 5.6: Writing Methods

The correct answer is E: 1 2 3 4 5 6 blackboard. All original values and names are printed. Changes made to arr and word do not affect the actual parameters num and name

## Question 37

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/2015q37.png?raw=true)

Topic 6.4: Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

The correct answer is E: II and III. Both II and III iterate through all the elements and order them in reverse.
