# Reflection

From Ms. Beveridge, my big takeaway is to not be stuck in your way and your path. There is so much to explore out there and if you are not open to exploring all the possibilities you may miss out on a lot of opportunities. Additionally, her insight on the importance of the impact that tech leaves on the world around us was very insightful. I think I relate to her in the way that I would like to work a job where I can feel the impact on what I have done and be able to contribute to the bettering of society around me. Finance definitely does also have an impact on society but it is very interesting to see direct impact and if that motivates good work then it is worth it. Also, it is interesting to see how wide of a spectrum an MBA is able to work, from high tech to biotech, it is an interesting pathway that fits many different company types.

From Mr. Porter, I learned the importance of continuing to learn. Most of the classes we are taking now is not that important content wise although it does provide a good base foundation, however they are able to teach us how to engage with content and work on problem solving. No matter what job we end up with in the future, whether in tech/engineering or not, we always need to learn new skills and one of the most valuable skill to have is to absorb new information. Additionally, he inspires me to want to continuously learn new skills and to never be satisfied. There is always more to learn and explore and that is an important part of living a fulfilling life.
