# Corrections: 

## Question 7

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/66q7.png?raw=true)

Topic 9.3: Overriding Methods

The correct answer is D: I and III. I will result in a compile-time error because method B has not been created yet. III also results in error because a1 is a private int so it can only be accessed by class A and not class B even if it is a subclass.

## Question 8

Topic 3.6: Equivalent Boolean Expressions

The correct answer is D: Expression I and expression II evaluate to the same value only when A and B differ. When A and B are different, I and II will both be false as it cannot be both A and B at the same time.

## Question 13

Topic 3.5: Compound Boolean Expressions

The correct answer is A: x. If an expression is x or y but also x it has to be x.

## Question 15

Topic 2.6: String Objects - Concatenation, Literals, and More
Topic 2.7: String Methods

The correct answer is A: containsArt ("rattrap", "similar", "today"). The ar in similar and the t combine in string all when the 3 words are added together creating the substring "art" even though none of the words contain art. 

## Question 16

Topic 8.2: Traversing 2D Arrays

The correct answer is C: Line  8  should be changed to for (int[] row : arr). This assigns row 8 to the row of the 2d array while the pervious line tries to set a row to a column.

## Question 16

Topic 8.2: Traversing 2D Arrays

The correct answer is C: Line  8  should be changed to for (int[] row : arr). This assigns row 8 to the row of the 2d array while the pervious line tries to set a row to a column.

## Notes

- substing: characters within a string
- compile-time error: error in syntax
- run-time error: error in code execution
- zero parameter constructor: requires no argument
