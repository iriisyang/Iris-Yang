# Corrections: 

## Question 7

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/66q7.png?raw=true)

Topic 9.3: Overriding Methods

The correct answer is D: I and III. I will result in a compile-time error because method B has not been created yet. III also results in error because a1 is a private int so it can only be accessed by class A and not class B even if it is a subclass.

## Question 8

Topic 3.6: Equivalent Boolean Expressions

The correct answer is D: Expression I and expression II evaluate to the same value only when A and B differ. When A and B are different, I and II will both be false as it cannot be both A and B at the same time.



## Notes

- substing: characters within a string
- compile-time error: error in syntax
- run-time error: error in code execution
- zero parameter constructor: requires no argument
