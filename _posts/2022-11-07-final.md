# Corrections: 

## Question 15

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/q15.png?raw=true)

The correct answer is A: I only. II is an incorrect option because once k reaches data.length-1, there will be an exception because it will not be able to check the next term as it does not exist. I is a correct option because if the previous value is greater than the current value, false is returned because the sequence of numbers would be decreasing rather than increasing.

## Question 16

The correct answer is D: k+a1.length. All the values of a1.length-1 is already taken by the first for loop. k+a1.length will access the the elements of a2 and add them to the array.

## Question 18

The correct answer is B (int) ( Math.random () * myList.size () ). The int function initializes values 0 and myList.size() – 1 inclusive. Math.random generates a random value 0 to 1 not including 1. It is then multiplied by myList.size to determine a random value in the list.

## Question 30

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/q30.png?raw=true)

The correct answer is C: "ilercom". The int howFar starts at 3, word.substring(howFar + 1, word.length()) is “iler”. Then word.substring(0, howFar) adds "com" to the end.

## Question 39

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/q39.png?raw=true)

The correct answer is D: 16. Since 27 is greater than 10, the call returns recur(recur(9)). recur(9) returns 18 since 9 is less than 10. recur(18) then returns recur(recur(6)). recur(6) returns 12. recur(12) returns recur(recur(4)). recur (4) returns 8 and recur(8) returns 16 finally. 

## Question 40

![This is an image](https://github.com/iriisyang/Iris-Yang/blob/master/images/q40.png?raw=true)

The correct answer is C: W/WA/WAT/WATC. whatsItDo(temp) is a recursive call and since it is placed before the line System.out.println(temp), it goes through WATC, WAT, and WA before reaching the base. It then prints from W to WATC due to the recursive call.

## Notes

- array lists always start from term 0
- compile: will code execute?
- calling manipulate
- int x : arr sets x as each value of the array
- recursions repeat the code and reenter value into loop
    - stops when returns a final value
- if printing an integer and calculation leads to decimal - round number
- Math.abs finds the absolute value of the function
- ! reverses what is inside the criteria and changes && to || and vice versa
